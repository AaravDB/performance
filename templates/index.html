            <p class="section-text">
                As parents, it's only natural to be concerned about your child's academic performance.  
                <span class="highlight">You want the best for them</span>, and every scorecard can feel like a reflection of their future.  
                Questions like <em>"Is my child falling behind?"</em> or <em>"Are we doing enough?"</em> are completely valid — and you're not alone in asking them.

            <h2 class="section-title">Performance is Deeply Personal</h2>
            <p class="section-text">
                Every child is unique. Their performance is shaped by numerous factors — family background, access to resources, peer influence, and even emotional well-being.  
                <br><br>
                Comparing children to a universal standard often ignores the context they’re growing up in.  
                <span class="highlight">True insight comes from understanding how your child is doing compared to peers in similar environments</span>.

            <p class="section-text">
                Our performance indicator model is built to offer an empathetic baseline —  
                <span class="highlight">a realistic, data-informed estimate</span> of how a student with similar background factors typically performs.
                <br><br>
                It’s not just a number. It's a tool to help you better understand your child’s educational path and set expectations grounded in reality.
